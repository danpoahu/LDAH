   - Event signups (count)
   - Event volunteers (actual people count)
   - Volunteer applications

   - Signups and volunteers per event

GOOGLE ANALYTICS:
-----------------

You already have Google Analytics (G-32PRRS0W85) set up on all pages.
The enhanced tracking also sends events to Google Analytics:
- 'volunteer_application' events
- 'event_signup' events

To view in Google Analytics:
1. Go to analytics.google.com
2. Select your LDAH property
3. Go to Reports > Engagement > Events

FIREBASE ANALYTICS COLLECTION:
-------------------------------

All tracking data is stored in Firebase Firestore in a collection called 'analytics'.

Each event includes:
- eventType (page_view, event_signup, volunteer_application_submitted)
- timestamp
- page location
- Additional data specific to the event type

TIPS FOR GOVERNMENT REPORTS:
-----------------------------

1. **Monthly Reports**: Set date range to "This Month", export CSV
2. **Quarterly Reports**: Use "This Quarter" setting
3. **Annual Reports**: Use "This Year" or set custom date from Jan 1 - Dec 31
4. **Grant Applications**: Use custom date range to match grant period

EXAMPLE REPORT USE CASES:
--------------------------

"In 2024, LDAH's website reached XXX visitors, facilitated XXX event signups 
resulting in XXX volunteers participating, and received XXX volunteer 
applications for ongoing opportunities."

"Our most popular event was [Event Name] with XXX signups and XXX volunteers."

"Month-over-month growth shows consistent community engagement with an average 
of XXX signups per month."

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

**No data showing?**
- Make sure you deployed all the updated files
- Click "Refresh Data" button
- Check that Firebase is working (test by submitting a signup)

**Numbers seem low?**
- Remember: tracking only starts from when you deploy these updates
- Historical data before this update is not tracked
- Check your date range settings

**Need help?**
- All data is in Firebase under the 'analytics' collection
- You can always export raw data from Firebase console

NEXT STEPS:
-----------

1. Deploy all updated files to your website
2. Test by:
   - Visiting volunteer.html (should track page view)
   - Submitting a test volunteer application
   - Checking analytics.html to see if data appears
3. Set a calendar reminder to pull monthly reports
4. Bookmark analytics.html for easy access

SECURITY NOTE:
--------------

The analytics dashboard uses the same password as your admin panel (ldah2024).
Consider changing this password in both admin.html and analytics.html for 
better security.

---
Questions? The analytics dashboard is self-contained in analytics.html, 
making it easy to maintain and update separately from your main admin panel.
